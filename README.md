# Snake_Game

[Watch the Gameplay Video](https://github.com/shaleen-11/Snake_Game/blob/main/Gameplay_video.mp4)

This is a simple Snake game developed using C++ and object-oriented programming concepts. The game runs in the terminal, where players control a snake to eat food, grow in length, and avoid collisions with itself. The game displays the live score and ends when the snake collides with itself.

Features
Console-Based Gameplay: The game runs directly in the terminal, providing a nostalgic, retro gaming experience.
Live Score Display: The current score is updated in real-time as the snake consumes food.
Smooth Controls: Use 'W', 'A', 'S', 'D' keys to move the snake up, left, down, and right, respectively.
Dynamic Game Board: The game board size dynamically adjusts to fit the console window size.
How to Play
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++ snake_game.cpp -o snake_game).
Run the executable (./snake_game on Unix-like systems or snake_game.exe on Windows).
Use the 'W', 'A', 'S', 'D' keys to control the snake's direction.
Eat the food ('o') to grow longer and increase your score.
Avoid running into the snake's body. The game ends if the snake collides with itself.
Enjoy playing the classic Snake game right in your terminal!

Requirements
C++ compiler
Windows operating system (due to the use of <conio.h> and <windows.h> libraries)
